## 📋 Prerequisites

**For most modules:**
- Python 3.10+
- Gemini API key from [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)

**For Vertex AI modules (08, 09, 18):**
- See [GCP Setup Guide](./docs/GCP_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/arjunprabhulal/google-adk-masterclass.git
cd google-adk-masterclass

# Set up environment
echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here" > .env
```

### Option 1: Using uv (Recommended)

```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run your first agent
cd 01-getting-started
adk web
```

### Option 2: Using pip

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run your first agent
cd 01-getting-started
adk web
```
